;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a sort of right-click contextual menu for
;; Emacs, accessed through the `embark-act' command (which you should
;; bind to a convenient key), offering you relevant actions to use on
;; a target determined by the context:

;; - In the minibuffer, the target is the current best completion
;;  candidate.
;; - In the `*Completions*' buffer the target is the completion at point.
;; - In a regular buffer, the target is the region if active, or else the
;;  file, symbol or url at point.

;; The type of actions offered depend on the type of the target:

;; - For files you get offered actions like deleting, copying,
;;  renaming, visiting in another window, running a shell command on the
;;  file, etc.
;; - For buffers the actions include switching to or killing the buffer.
;; - For package names the actions include installing, removing or
;;  visiting the homepage.

;; Everything is easily configurable: determining the current target,
;; classifying it, and deciding with actions are offered for each type
;; in the classification.  The above introduction just mentions part of
;; the default configuration.

;; Configuring which actions are offered for a type is particularly
;; easy and requires no programming: the `embark-keymap-alist'
;; variable associates target types with variable containing keymaps,
;; and those keymaps containing binds for the actions.  For example,
;; in the default configuration the type `file' is associated with the
;; symbol `embark-file-keymap'.  That symbol names a keymap with
;; single-letter key bindings for common Emacs file commands, for
;; instance `c' is bound to `copy-file'.  This means that if while you
;; are in the minibuffer after running a command that prompts for a
;; file, such as `find-file' or `rename-file', you can copy a file by
;; running `embark-act' and then pressing `c'.

;; These action keymaps are very convenient but not strictly necessary
;; when using `embark-act': you can use any command that reads from the
;; minibuffer as an action and the target of the action will be inserted
;; at the first minibuffer prompt.  After running `embark-act' all of your
;; key bindings and even `execute-extended-command' can be used to run a
;; command.  The action keymaps are normal Emacs keymaps and you should
;; feel free to bind in them whatever commands you find useful as actions.

;; The actions in `embark-general-map' are available no matter what
;; type of completion you are in the middle of.  By default this
;; includes bindings to save the current candidate in the kill ring
;; and to insert the current candidate in the previously selected
;; buffer (the buffer that was current when you executed a command
;; that opened up the minibuffer).

;; You can read about the Embark GitHub project wiki:
;; https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Default-Actions

;; Besides acting individually on targets, Embark lets you work
;; collectively on a set of target candidates.  For example, while
;; you are in the minibuffer the candidates are simply the possible
;; completions of your input.  Embark provides three commands to work
;; on candidate sets:

;; - The `embark-act-all' command runs the same action on each of the
;;   current candidates.  It is just like using `embark-act' on each
;;   candidate in turn.

;; - The `embark-collect' command produces a buffer listing all
;;   candidates, for you to peruse and run actions on at your leisure.
;;   The candidates are displayed as a list showing additional
;;   annotations.

;; - The `embark-export' command tries to open a buffer in an
;;   appropriate major mode for the set of candidates.  If the
;;   candidates are files export produces a Dired buffer; if they are
;;   buffers, you get an Ibuffer buffer; and if they are packages you
;;   get a buffer in package menu mode.

;; These are always available as "actions" (although they do not act
;; on just the current target but on all candidates) for embark-act
;; and are bound to A, S (for "snapshot") and E, respectively, in
;; embark-general-map.  This means that you do not have to bind your
;; own key bindings for these (although you can, of course), just a
;; key binding for `embark-act'.

When the source of a target is minibuffer completion, the default

For example, if you run `delete-file' the default action for its
completion candidates is `delete-file' itself.  You may prefer to
make `find-file' the default action for all files, even if they
wre obtained from a `delete-file' prompt.  In that case you can
configure that by adding an entry to this variable pairing `file'
with `find-file'.

In addition to target types, you can also use as keys in this alist,
pairs of a target type and a command name.  Such a pair indicates that
the override only applies if the target was obtained from minibuffer
completion from that command.  For example adding an
entry (cons (cons \\='file \\='delete-file) \\='find-file) to this alist would
indicate that for files at the prompt of the `delete-file' command,

(defcustom embark-indicators
  '(embark-mixed-indicator
    embark-highlight-indicator
    embark-isearch-highlight-indicator)
  "Indicator functions to use when acting or becoming.
The indicator functions are called from both `embark-act' and
from `embark-become' and should display information about this to
the user, such as: which of those two commands is running; a
description of the key bindings that are available for actions or
commands to become; and, in the case of `embark-act', the type
and value of the targets, and whether other targets are available
via `embark-cycle'.  The indicator function is free to display as
much or as little of this information as desired and can use any
Emacs interface elements to do so.

Embark comes with five such indicators:

- `embark-minimal-indicator', which does not display any
  information about keybindings, but does display types and
  values of acton targets in the echo area or minibuffer prompt,

- `embark-verbose-indicator', which pops up a buffer containing
  detailed information including key bindings and the first line
  of the docstring of the commands they run, and

- `embark-mixed-indicator', which combines the minimal and the
  verbose indicator: the minimal indicator is shown first and the
  verbose popup is shown after `embark-mixed-indicator-delay'
  seconds.

- `embark-highlight-indicator', which highlights the target
  at point.

- `embark-isearch-highlight-indicator', which when the target at
  point is an indentifier or symbol, lazily highlights all
  occurrences of it.

The protocol for indicator functions is as follows:

When called from `embark-act', an indicator function is called
without arguments.  The indicator function should then return a
closure, which captures the indicator state.  The returned
closure must accept up to three optional arguments, the action
keymap, the targets (plists as returned by `embark--targets') and
the prefix keys typed by the user so far.  The keymap, targets
and prefix keys may be updated when cycling targets at point
resulting in multiple calls to the closure.  When called from
`embark-become', the indicator closure will be called with the
keymap of commands to become, a fake target list containing a
single target of type `embark-become' and whose value is the
minibuffer input, and the prefix set to nil.  Note, in
particular, that if an indicator function wishes to distinguish
between `embark-act' and `embark-become' it should check whether
the `car' of the first target is `embark-become'.

After the action has been performed the indicator closure is
called without arguments, such that the indicator can perform the
necessary cleanup work.  For example, if the indicator adds
overlays, it should remove these overlays.  The indicator should
be written in a way that it is safe to call it for cleanup more
than once, in fact, it should be able to handle any sequence of
update and cleanup calls ending in a call for cleanup.

NOTE: Experience shows that the indicator calling convention may
change again in order to support more action features.  The
calling convention should currently be considered unstable.
Please keep this in mind when writing a custom indicator
function, or when using the `which-key' indicator function from
the wiki."

By default, if called from a minibuffer the target is the top

`embark-cycle' (which is bound by default to the same key
binding `embark-act' is, but see `embark-cycle-key').

This command uses `embark-prompter' to ask the user to specify an
action, and calls it injecting the target at the first minibuffer
prompt.

If you call this from the minibuffer, it can optionally quit the
minibuffer.  The variable `embark-quit-after-action' controls
whether calling `embark-act' with nil ARG quits the minibuffer,
and if ARG is non-nil it will do the opposite.  Interactively,
ARG is the prefix argument.

DOC is the documentation string.

BINDINGS specifies the key bindings as (string command) pairs;

Before the actual list of binding pairs you can include the
keyword `:parent' followed by a keymap, to specify a parent for
the defined keymap.  If the `:parent' keymap is absent,
`embark-general-map' is used by default.

If you intend to use the keymap defined by this macro with Embark
as an action keymap, it is recommended that you add a binding for
RET to an action that makes sense as a default for the type of
target you will the keymap for.  For example, in
`embark-file-map' RET is bound to `find-file' by default.

Note, though, that the binding for RET may be overridden at the
moment `embark-act' is called, either by an entry from
`embark-default-action-overrides', or if there is no relevant
