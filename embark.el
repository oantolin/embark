;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a sort of right-click contextual menu for
;; Emacs, accessed through the `embark-act' command (which you should
;; bind to a convenient key), offering you relevant actions to use on
;; a target determined by the context:

;; - In the minibuffer, the target is the current best completion
;;  candidate.
;; - In the `*Completions*' buffer the target is the completion at point.
;; - In a regular buffer, the target is the region if active, or else the
;;  file, symbol or url at point.

;; The type of actions offered depend on the type of the target:

;; - For files you get offered actions like deleting, copying,
;;  renaming, visiting in another window, running a shell command on the
;;  file, etc.
;; - For buffers the actions include switching to or killing the buffer.
;; - For package names the actions include installing, removing or
;;  visiting the homepage.

;; Everything is easily configurable: determining the current target,
;; classifying it, and deciding with actions are offered for each type
;; in the classification.  The above introduction just mentions part of
;; the default configuration.

;; Configuring which actions are offered for a type is particularly
;; easy and requires no programming: the `embark-keymap-alist'
;; variable associates target types with variable containing keymaps,
;; and those keymaps containing binds for the actions.  For example,
;; in the default configuration the type `file' is associated with the
;; symbol `embark-file-keymap'.  That symbol names a keymap with
;; single-letter keybindings for common Emacs file commands, for
;; instance `c' is bound to `copy-file'.  This means that if while you
;; are in the minibuffer after running a command that prompts for a
;; file, such as `find-file' or `rename-file', you can copy a file by
;; running `embark-act' and then pressing `c'.

;; These action keymaps are very convenient but not strictly necessary
;; when using `embark-act': you can use any command that reads from the
;; minibuffer as an action and the target of the action will be inserted
;; at the first minibuffer prompt.  After running `embark-act' all of your
;; keybindings and even `execute-extended-command' can be used to run a
;; command.  The action keymaps are normal Emacs keymaps and you should
;; feel free to bind in them whatever commands you find useful as actions.

;; The actions in `embark-general-map' are available no matter what
;; type of completion you are in the middle of.  By default this
;; includes bindings to save the current candidate in the kill ring
;; and to insert the current candidate in the previously selected
;; buffer (the buffer that was current when you executed a command
;; that opened up the minibuffer).

;; You can read about the Embark GitHub project wiki:
;; https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Default-Actions

;; Besides acting individually on targets, Embark lets you work
;; collectively on a set of target candidates.  For example, while
;; you are in the minibuffer the candidates are simply the possible
;; completions of your input.  Embark provides three commands to work
;; on candidate sets:

;; - The `embark-collect-snapshot' command produces a buffer listing
;;   all candidates, for you to peruse and run actions on at your
;;   leisure.  The candidates can be viewed in a grid or as a list
;;   showing additional annotations.  The `embark-collect-live'
;;   variant produces "live" Embark Collect buffers, meaning they
;;   autoupdate as the set of candidates changes.

;; - The `embark-export' command tries to open a buffer in an
;;   appropriate major mode for the set of candidates.  If the
;;   candidates are files export produces a Dired buffer; if they are
;;   buffers, you get an Ibuffer buffer; and if they are packages you
;;   get a buffer in package menu mode.

;; These are always available as "actions" (although they do not act
;; on just the current target but on all candidates) for embark-act and
;; are bound to S, L and E, respectively, in embark-general-map.  This
;; means that you do not have to bind your own key bindings for these
;; (although you can, of course), just a key binding for `embark-act'.
