;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a sort of right-click contextual menu for
;; Emacs, accessed through the `embark-act' command (which you should
;; bind to a convenient key), offering you relevant actions to use on
;; a target determined by the context:

;; - In the minibuffer, the target is the current best completion
;;  candidate.
;; - In the `*Completions*' buffer the target is the completion at point.
;; - In a regular buffer, the target is the region if active, or else the
;;  file, symbol or url at point.

;; The type of actions offered depend on the type of the target:

;; - For files you get offered actions like deleting, copying,
;;  renaming, visiting in another window, running a shell command on the
;;  file, etc.
;; - For buffers the actions include switching to or killing the buffer.
;; - For package names the actions include installing, removing or
;;  visiting the homepage.

;; Everything is easily configurable: determining the current target,
;; classifying it, and deciding with actions are offered for each type
;; in the classification.  The above introduction just mentions part of
;; the default configuration.

;; Configuring which actions are offered for a type is particularly
;; easy and requires no programming: the `embark-keymap-alist'
;; variable associates target types with variable containing keymaps,
;; and those keymaps containing binds for the actions.  For example,
;; in the default configuration the type `file' is associated with the
;; symbol `embark-file-keymap'.  That symbol names a keymap with
;; single-letter key bindings for common Emacs file commands, for
;; instance `c' is bound to `copy-file'.  This means that if while you
;; are in the minibuffer after running a command that prompts for a
;; file, such as `find-file' or `rename-file', you can copy a file by
;; running `embark-act' and then pressing `c'.

;; These action keymaps are very convenient but not strictly necessary
;; when using `embark-act': you can use any command that reads from the
;; minibuffer as an action and the target of the action will be inserted
;; at the first minibuffer prompt.  After running `embark-act' all of your
;; key bindings and even `execute-extended-command' can be used to run a
;; command.  The action keymaps are normal Emacs keymaps and you should
;; feel free to bind in them whatever commands you find useful as actions.

;; The actions in `embark-general-map' are available no matter what
;; type of completion you are in the middle of.  By default this
;; includes bindings to save the current candidate in the kill ring
;; and to insert the current candidate in the previously selected
;; buffer (the buffer that was current when you executed a command
;; that opened up the minibuffer).

;; You can read about the Embark GitHub project wiki:
;; https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Default-Actions

;; Besides acting individually on targets, Embark lets you work
;; collectively on a set of target candidates.  For example, while
;; you are in the minibuffer the candidates are simply the possible
;; completions of your input.  Embark provides three commands to work
;; on candidate sets:

;; - The `embark-collect-snapshot' command produces a buffer listing
;;   all candidates, for you to peruse and run actions on at your
;;   leisure.  The candidates can be viewed in a grid or as a list
;;   showing additional annotations.  The `embark-collect-live'
;;   variant produces "live" Embark Collect buffers, meaning they
;;   autoupdate as the set of candidates changes.

;; - The `embark-export' command tries to open a buffer in an
;;   appropriate major mode for the set of candidates.  If the
;;   candidates are files export produces a Dired buffer; if they are
;;   buffers, you get an Ibuffer buffer; and if they are packages you
;;   get a buffer in package menu mode.

;; These are always available as "actions" (although they do not act
;; on just the current target but on all candidates) for embark-act and
;; are bound to S, L and E, respectively, in embark-general-map.  This
;; means that you do not have to bind your own key bindings for these
;; (although you can, of course), just a key binding for `embark-act'.

The indicator function is called from both `embark-act' and from
`embark-become' and should display information about this to the

description of the key bindings that are available for actions or
commands to become; and, in the case of `embark-act', the type
and value of the targets, and whether other targets are available
via `embark-cycle'.  The indicator function is free to display as
much or as little of this information as desired and can use any
Emacs interface elements to do so.

Embark comes with two such indicators:

- `embark-minimal-indicator', which does not display any
  information about keybindings, but does display types and
  values of acton targets, and

- `embark-verbose-indicator', which pops up a buffer containing
  detailed information including key bindings and the first line
  of the docstring of the commands they run.

The calling convention for indicator functions is as follows:

When called from `embark-act', the indicator function will be
called with the action keymap, the target (in the form of a cons
of the type and value) and a list of other shadowed targets (each
of which is also a cons).  When called from `embark-become', the
indicator function will be called the keymap of commands to
become, with a fake target of type `embark-become' and whose
value is the minibuffer input, and with nil.  Note, in
particular, that if an indicator function wishes to distinguish
between `embark-act' and `embark-become' it should check whether
the `car' of its target argument is `embark-become'.

The function should return either nil or a function to be called
when the indicator is no longer needed to clean up the display.
For example, if the indicator works by adding overlays, it should
return a function that removes those overlays."

If FULL is non-nil (interactively, if called with a prefix
argument), the entire minibuffer contents are used as the initial
input of the new command.  By default only the part of the
minibuffer contents between the current completion boundaries is
taken.  What this means is fairly technical, but (1) usually
there is no difference: the completion boundaries include the
entire minibuffer contents, and (2) the most common case where
these notions differ is file completion, in which case the
completion boundaries single out the path component containing
point."
