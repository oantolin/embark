;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides integration between Embark and Consult.  The package
;; will be loaded automatically by Embark.

;; Some of the functionality here was previously contained in Embark
;; itself:

;; - Support for consult-buffer, so that you get the correct actions
;; for each type of entry in consult-buffer's list.

;; - Support for consult-line, consult-outline, consult-mark and
;; consult-global-mark, so that the insert and save actions don't
;; include a weird unicode character at the start of the line, and so
;; you can export from them to an occur buffer (where occur-edit-mode
;; works!).

;; Just load this package to get the above functionality, no further
;; configuration is necessary.

;; Additionally this package contains some functionality that has
;; never been in Embark: access to Consult preview from auto-updating
;; Embark Collect buffer that is associated to an active minibuffer
;; for a Consult command.  For information on Consult preview, see
;; Consult's info manual or its readme on GitHub.

;; If you always want the minor mode enabled whenever it possible use:

;; (add-hook 'embark-collect-mode-hook #'consult-preview-at-point-mode)

;; If you don't want the minor mode automatically on and prefer to
;; trigger the consult previews manually use this instead:

;; (keymap-set embark-collect-mode-map "C-j"
;;   #'consult-preview-at-point)
